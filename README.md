## Technologies

This app was built with Angular, Firebase, and Bootstrap 4.

## What I leanred
- Built a fully functional, serverless e-shop web application featuring user authentication, product catalogue, shopping cart, and check out modules; supported order-tracking and product management functions for admin users

- Implemented routing, product forms, and order logs with Angular; styled UI elements and added filtering logic with Bootstrap 4 and Angular Material

- Leveraged Firebase to support authentication and utilized Angular to fetch and load data asynchronously from Firebase Realtime Database to enhance website responsiveness
